# Advent of Code 2022

This year, I am back! Last year, I tried solving [Advent of Code 2021 using Elixir][1]. I really loved it. [Elixir] is still one of my favorite languages, if not the most favorite.

But this year, I am trying it using [Rust]. Again, I haven't learned Rust. I am learning it as we speak.
